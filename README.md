# melomaniac-prototype


A flask app that uses Spotify's APIs to fetch user data and make changes to the user's profile.


Creates a personalized playlist based on the user's listening history.


## **The web app needs a database to serve the internet**


I need to implement a database if I want my app to be used by others due to the nature of Spotify's authorization practices, so I have disabled my web app at the moment.
I will enable the web app again once I have implemented a database.
